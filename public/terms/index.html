        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms govern your use of EventBuddy AI, including the website and the EventBuddy
          Discord application (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Access and Eligibility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must comply with Discord's Terms, Community Guidelines, and Developer Policy.</li>
          <li>You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum digital consent age in your region.</li>
          <li>Server administrators are responsible for configuring permissions and deciding where
          the bot can operate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Use of the Service</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not misuse the Service, interfere with its operation, or attempt to access it using
          methods other than the interfaces provided.</li>
          <li>You will not upload or share unlawful content, spam, or malicious code.</li>
          <li>You agree to follow rate limits and respect other users in shared channels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains what information we process and why.
          By using the Service, you consent to that processing. Server admins should ensure they
          have a lawful basis before uploading attendee data (e.g., CSV files) to the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>5. AI and Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          EventBuddy integrates with Discord, Supabase, and Google Generative AI. Your use of those
          services is subject to their terms. We are not responsible for third‑party outages or
          changes.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Acceptable Use and Safety</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not attempt to prompt‑inject, exfiltrate secrets, or bypass safety systems.</li>
          <li>Do not use the Service to harass, discriminate, or violate intellectual property.</li>
          <li>Request only the permissions your server needs; least‑privilege is recommended.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service or any feature at any time. We may also
          update these Terms; material changes will be reflected by updating the date on this page.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. AI‑GENERATED CONTENT MAY
          BE INACCURATE OR UNSUITABLE; USE DISCRETION BEFORE ACTING ON IT.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
          SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You may stop using the Service at any time, including removing the bot from your server.
          We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or pose a risk to users
          or the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of your place of residence or our place of business
          (to be specified by you). Disputes will be resolved in the competent courts of that venue.
